# **Introductions**
May I is a family friendly card game adapted by the Clenney family, it is closely related to Gin Rummy or Double deck Rummy and originated in Europe.

## **Objective**

The objective of May I is to be the player with the fewest penalty points after playing all seven hands. Everyone draws one card, the high card deals, and the subsequent deals are passed to the left.

3 52-card decks are used. The number of decks used additional to the base of two is determined by dividing the number of players by two and rounding up if needed. For example:

-4 players 3 decks
-5 players 3 decks
-6 players 3 decks 
-7 players 4 decks 
-8 players 4 decks

To make the game more interesting challenge yourself by only using 3 decks.
Each player is dealt 11 cards, the remaining stock pile is set on the table. after a card is drawn, one must be discarded, and the next player to the left has the option of drawing either the top of the discard or top of stock card then they must discard.
A set consists of three or more cards of the same face value, (three queens, or three aces, or three jacks). A run consists of four or more cards of the same suit, in sequence. IF there is an ace in the run, it can serve as either high card and or low card, and can both in the same run. No run may contain more than 13 cards.

## **Rules**

Seven different deals, or hands, make up one game. Each hand consists of a combination of sets and runs, and there is a different opening requirement for each of the seven hands. The first hand requires a player to open or "go down" with two sets. A minimum of six cards makes up the first hands opening requirements, seven cards for the second hand, etc. Everyone moves on to the next round regardless of whether they were able to go down during the previous hand. 
Once a player has gone down by satisfying the requirements for that particular hand, they may not create any new sets or runs. While playing the first hand of two sets, no player may play three sets. Cards that remain in a players hand may only be played onto the sets and runs already established on the table one round after a player has "gone down"

The sequence of seven hands is as follows:

1. 2 sets
1. 1 set 1 run 
1. 2 runs 
1. 3 sets
1. 2 sets 1 run
1. 2 runs 1 set 
1. 3 runs (all played no throw away)

For those hands that require multiple runs, a player is not permitted to play 2 runs of the same suit. example: you may not have a run of hearts (1,2,3,4) and then the same suit (5,6,7,8)

## **Deal** 

All players pick a card at random and return it to the deck, high card dealing first. Each hand starts a new deal, with the turn to deal passing from player to player, to the left. Cards are dealt one at a time, face down beginning at the dealers left. The dealer deals 11 cards face down to each player, places the remainder of the pack face down in the middle, and places the top card from the stock pile face up next to it. Play starts with the player to the dealers left and proceeds clockwise.

## **Play** 

Beginning with the player to the left of the dealer a persons turn begins by selecting either the top card from the stock pile, or the top card from the discard pile. if the player does not wish to select from the discard pile, any player in order of rotation to the left of the player may claim that card, but must also draw the top card from the stock pile as a penalty for picking out of turn, without discarding. Conventionally this desire is announced by saying "May I?", thus the alternative name of this game. If several players wish the top card, the priority goes to the desiring player closet in rotation to the current player. In such case:

- The order of a play is not changed
- The player picking out of turn may not play any cards on the table until their next regular turn
- Any remaining cards in the discard pile are ineligible for selection 
- The player whose turn was interrupted resumes play by selecting the top card from the stock pile

As a point of strategy, it is occasionally advantageous to "may i" for a card not directly useful, in hopes the penalty card will be more useful.
If the player has not yet opened, and has the necessary cards to meet the opening requirements for that hand, they may then lay down the sets and runs appropriate for that hand.  Having opened,, the player is then free to play (in that same turn and in subsequent turns) additional cards onto existing sets or runs that have already been played on the table. A player may not put any cards into play until they have opened (gone down).
The end of turn occurs when a player discards one card onto the discard pile. Play then continues with the next player to the left.

## **Scoring** 

Since May I is a game winnable based on the fewest points, you get 5 points for cards 2-9. 10 and face cards count as 10. Aces are 15.

## **Rules of play**

### Stock pile depletion

**It is possible when many cards have been taken out of turn in a hand, resulting in many penalty cards, that the stock pile may dwindle down to nothing before any player has gone out. Should this happen, the discard pile is turned over once, without shuffling, and becomes the stock pile. Play then continues in order. If the remaining cards in the stock pile are depleted a second time without any player going out, the hand ends and all points remaining in all platers hands are tallied as they would be had someone gone out.**

### Illegal draw

**if, by playing out of turn or by drawing more than one card from the top of the stock pile, a player sees a card to which they are not entitled, that card is placed face up on top of the stock pile, and proceed to play as if no irregularity had occurred. If more than one card is so exposed at the top of the stock pile, the option of each player in turn is only to take the top such card remaining there, or the top face down card of the stock pile, or the previous players discard. That is, players have three options to draw from instead of the normal two, as long as exposed cards remain at the top of the stock pile.**

**A players illegal draw may not be corrected after discarding, but the section on incorrect hand may apply.** 

### **Incorrect hand**

- A player with too many cards discards without drawing.
- A player with too few cards draws without discarding; one card in each turn until the players hand is restored to the correct number. this also applies to a player who draws too many cards and adds them to their hand before correction is required.
- A player may not lay down any cards in a turn when the hand is still incorrect
- If, after a player goes out another player has too many cards they simply count the value of all cards in the hand.
- If a player has too few cards, they are charged 10 points for each missing card, 
- If any player goes out and is found to have too dew cards they take back all cards that were laid down in that turn, and play continues.

### **Re-deal**

There must be re-deal, by the same dealer, if more than one card is exposed in dealing or if more than one card is found face up in the pack. A player who is dealt an incorrect number of cards may demand a re deal before drawing in their first turn, but not after that. There must be a re deal at any time it is discovered that the pack is incorrect, but the results of previous deals are not affected.

### **Cards laid down illegally**

Any cards which are superfluous in an otherwise correct set or run must be returned to the original players hand as soon as they are discovered. any cards that may have been added to the incorrect set or run remain on the table. Play then proceeds as if no irregularity had occurred. 

### **Scoring errors** 

An error a counting hand may not be corrected after that hand has been mixed with other cards. however, if an error in scoring is discovered when there had previously been no dispute, an agreed upon correction may be made at any time
